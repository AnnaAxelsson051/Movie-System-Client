# MOVIE SYSTEM

## Description 

This is an application where users can add their favourite genres and movies on a personal users page - as well as add ratings for movies they have watched. Users are rendered on the page from a database set up in Azure Datastudio and information is exchanged with the database via a [Movie System Server](https://github.com/AnnaAxelsson051/Movie-System-Server) I have built. The server is built with C# / .NET and it also fetches data from The Movie Database (TMDB) via an external API.
