# MOVIE SYSTEM
---
## Description

This is an application where users can collect their favourite genres and movies on a personal users page, as well as add ratings for movies they have watched. Users are rendered on the page from a database set up in Azure Datastudio and information is exchanged with the database via a server (LinkToRepo) I have built. The server is built with C# / .NET and also fetches data from The Movie Database (TMDB) via an external API.
